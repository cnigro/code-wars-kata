# The year of 2013 is the first year after the old 1987 with only distinct
# digits.

# Now your task is to solve the following problem: given a year number,
# find the minimum year number which is strictly larger than the given one
# and has only distinct digits.

# Input/Output
# [input] integer year; 1000 â‰¤ year â‰¤ 9000
# [output] an integer; the minimum year number that is strictly larger than
#          the input number year and all its digits are distinct.

def distinct_digit_year(year)
  (year + 1).upto(9000) { |n| return n if n.digits.uniq == n.digits }
end

p distinct_digit_year(1987) == 2013
p distinct_digit_year(2013) == 2014
p distinct_digit_year(2229) == 2301
